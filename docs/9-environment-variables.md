# ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

Refer to the [`.env.example`](../src/.env.example) for the required environment variables.


The application expects the `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENTS` variable to contain the names of each Azure OpenAI deployment. Use a JSON string in the following format:

```json
{"gpt-4o","o4-mini"}
```
=======
Key OpenAI settings include:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME` â€“ your Azure OpenAI resource name.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENTS` â€“ JSON mapping of model names to deployment names.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` â€“ deployment name of the default model.

Each conversation is represented by a `ChatThreadModel`. A new optional field
`deploymentName` was introduced to record which Azure OpenAI deployment a chat
uses. When creating a new chat thread (for example via `CreateChatThread` or
`CreatePersonaChat`) you can specify the deployment name to use. If omitted, the
chat thread automatically defaults to the value of
`AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
