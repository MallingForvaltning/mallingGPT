# ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

Refer to the [`.env.example`](../src/.env.example) for the required environment variables.

The application expects the `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENTS` variable to map model names to the corresponding deployment names. Provide the mappings using a JSON string like the following:

```json
{
  "gpt-4o": "o4-mini"
}
```

Key OpenAI settings include:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME` â€“ your Azure OpenAI resource name.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENTS` â€“ JSON mapping of model names to deployment names.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` â€“ deployment name of the default model.

Each conversation is represented by a `ChatThreadModel`. A new optional field
`deploymentName` was introduced to record which Azure OpenAI deployment a chat
uses. When creating a new chat thread (for example via `CreateChatThread` or
`CreatePersonaChat`) you can specify the deployment name to use. If omitted, the
chat thread automatically defaults to the value of
`AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
